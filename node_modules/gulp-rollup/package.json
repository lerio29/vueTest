  "readme": "# gulp-rollup [![npm][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Dependency Status][david-image]][david-url] [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url]\n\nThis plugin allows [gulp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp) to populate a virtual filesystem and feed it to the [Rollup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup) ES6 module bundler.\n\n**Note: This plugin is not appropriate for most use cases,** as it requires every file expected to be imported by Rollup to be loaded into memory preemptively. [rollup-stream](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/recipes/rollup-with-rollup-stream.md) is preferred for almost all purposes. If you want to transform/synthesize/alias/etc. the files Rollup processes, use Rollup plugins; if there's no Rollup plugin to do what you want, try the gulp-to-Rollup plugin adapter, [rollup-plugin-gulp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-gulp). If you really need to synthesize your files in gulp, go ahead and use gulp-rollup&mdash;that's what it's made for.\n\n## Install\n\n``` bash\nnpm install --save-dev gulp-rollup\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n``` js\nvar gulp       = require('gulp'),\n    rollup     = require('gulp-rollup');\n\ngulp.task('bundle', function() {\n  gulp.src('./src/**/*.js')\n    // transform the files here.\n    .pipe(rollup({\n      // any option supported by Rollup can be set here.\n      entry: './src/main.js'\n    }))\n    .pipe(gulp.dest('./dist'));\n});\n```\n\n## Usage with sourcemaps\n\n``` js\nvar gulp       = require('gulp'),\n    rollup     = require('gulp-rollup'),\n    sourcemaps = require('gulp-sourcemaps');\n\ngulp.task('bundle', function() {\n  gulp.src('./src/**/*.js')\n    .pipe(sourcemaps.init())\n      // transform the files here.\n      .pipe(rollup({\n        entry: './src/main.js'\n      }))\n    .pipe(sourcemaps.write())\n    .pipe(gulp.dest('./dist'));\n});\n```\n\n## Multiple entry points\n\nIf an array of strings is passed into `options.entry`, a separate bundle will be rolled up from each entry point. They will be processed in parallel and output in no particular order. As usual, each bundle will have the same path as the associated entry file.\n\nIn addition, a Promise that resolves to a string or array of strings can be passed into `options.entry`. This is to make it more convenient to use asynchronous methods to locate entry files.\n\n## Options\n\nIn addition to [the standard Rollup options](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/wiki/JavaScript-API), gulp-rollup supports `options.rollup`, allowing you to use an older, newer, or custom version of Rollup by passing in the module like so:\n\n``` js\ngulp.src('./src/**/*.js')\n  .pipe(rollup({\n    rollup: require('rollup'),\n    entry: './src/main.js'\n  }))\n  //...\n```\n\nIf `options.allowRealFiles` is set to true, gulp-rollup will break the gulp plugin guidelines just for you and allow Rollup to read files directly from the filesystem when a file with a matching name isn't found in the gulp stream. You could use this to weasel your way out of having to use rollup-stream, but that would make you a terrible person.\n\nBy default, gulp-rollup will mimic Rollup by adding a .js extension to imports if necessary. You can customize this behavior by setting `options.impliedExtensions` to an array of extensions, like `['.js', '.es', '.jsx']`. If `options.impliedExtensions` is set to `false` or an empty array, file extensions in imports will be treated as mandatory.\n\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/gulp-rollup\n[npm-image]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/gulp-rollup.svg\n[david-url]: https://david-dm.org/mcasimir/gulp-rollup\n[david-image]: https://img.shields.io/david/mcasimir/gulp-rollup/master.svg\n[travis-url]: https://travis-ci.org/mcasimir/gulp-rollup\n[travis-image]: https://img.shields.io/travis/mcasimir/gulp-rollup/master.svg\n",
